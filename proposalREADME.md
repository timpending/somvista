# Capstone Submission - TIM PENDER
Submit your capstone ideas here for approval. Fork, clone, and send a pull request with these details about your app:

# Technologies Being Used:
- MediaRecorder API
- AudioContext API
- CSS3 / SASS
- HTML5

# IDEA 1. SoundSight (Working Title)
* A brief description of your project
Responsive web application that will allow users to record or upload sounds recordings to the application.  Application would then analyze the input and reflect the sound waves visually.  Custom UI would allow the users to edit the base color scheme, wave type, wave output in a visually pleasing and intuitive way (MVP).  Ideally users would be able to save the output, and then turn it into a print or t-shirt (advanced features).  

* What technologies do you plan to use (just list them)
- Web Audio API
- D3
- HTML5
- CSS3 / SASS

* What will your MVP be?
The recording upload and the visualization of what was recorded.  UI to control the visually pleasing aspects of the recording,(color, bar length). Public login only for MVP.

* What features will you add if you have time?
- Upload / or Instant record depending on which was supported in MVP
- Full CRUD support for signing up, saving, creating designs
- OAuth Login
- Advanced Design / UI features - waveform, mirrored waveform support.
- Ability to order custom designs and have them printed on t-shirt or poster
- Compile/output the full wave while recording (if recording over upload is selected)


# IDEA 2. Falling platform Game (working title - not even close)

* A brief description of your project
- Game in which platforms are randomly generated, falling from the top of the screen. User needs to navigate the spaces between them and avoid getting pushed off the screen.  

* What technologies do you plan to use (just list them)
- Phaser
- CSS
- JS
- HTML5

* What will your MVP be?
- Basic, functional game in which the platforms, randomly generated platforms, user can navigate the mazes move up and down.
- If user gets pushed off the bottom of the screen, then they lose.  

* What features will you add if you have time?
- Power Ups - wall destruction, score booster
- Sound
- Impactful visual effects

# Project Constraints
You must successfully complete a capstone project that adheres to the following guidelines. Your project must:

* Be sufficiently unique in the cohort
* Have client-side functionality
* Client-side code may use jQuery, React, Angular etc...
* Client-side code may be part of Express, or a separate repo
* Have server-side functionality
* Server-side code may be in Rails, Node/Express, PHP, Python, Go etc..
* Server-side code must include some kind of persistence - PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis etc...
* Look decent - either using custom CSS or uniquely modified Bootstrap / Semantic
* Be deployed and ready to demo by the provided deadline
* Have some sort of API integration (email, maps, stocks, text messages, physical devices etc...)
* The ideal project has functionality visible to non-logged-in users (easier for employers to see).

The more creative the better! Anything from card/board games to highly-specific financial apps or apps you wished you had in previous jobs or other situations are all good candidates.

NOTE: in rare cases apps that don't have all of these components may be approved by instructors. If you believe your app is sufficiently complex and awesome, please submit your ideas.

## Process
Submit one _bangin'_ idea for your project, or 2 if you're not sure.

Instructors will evaluate and choose the one that seems the most promising (or ask you to go back to the drawing board)

Once an idea has been approved, you must create a plan such as:
* rough wireframes
* rough stories
* links to documentation proving you can get what you need from APIs etc...
* Start building!

There will be 1 mid-point checkin with an instructor, with one chance for feedback. Other than that you are largely on your own ('cuz, you know, it's a capstone project)

NOTE: if you already have code on a personal project and want to continue, please submit that along with other ideas, so instructors can evaluate.

## Assessment

Applications will be judged on being:

* 100% your own. Copy / cheat and you will automatically fail.
* complete (according to the requirements above)
* fully-functional
* sufficiently modern-looking
* sufficiently complex

## Rationale

This capstone project will demonstrate your ability to build fullstack applications from start to finish in a fixed amount of time. You will demo this application at hiring day, and feature it prominently on your resume.
